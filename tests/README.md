**Automated Testing**<br>
Tests get ran by GitHub actions every time you commit to the repository or create a pull request.

**Manual Testing**<br>
For aspects of SebMedia that cannot be automatically tested, refer to manual-testing.md to read instructions on how to do manual testing.

**Test Results**<br>
The tests have succeeded if the process exits with no errors

If the test failed, an error will be thrown with information about what happened.
Also if a test failed, the other tests in tests.js will not run.
